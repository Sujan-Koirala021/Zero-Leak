# üö® ZeroLeaks

**ZeroLeaks** is a security-focused tool designed to scan public GitHub repositories for exposed API keys and other critical vulnerabilities. Simply provide a GitHub URL, and ZeroLeaks will locate and report any sensitive information leaks‚Äîhelping you secure your code before attackers can exploit it.

---

## üí° How It Started

While casually scrolling through social media, we stumbled upon a video showcasing how exposed API keys on GitHub could be exploited. Out of curiosity, we tested the method and shockingly discovered **three valid API keys**. That moment sparked the creation of **ZeroLeaks**‚Äîa tool to help developers identify and fix such vulnerabilities in their own projects.

## **Usage**

### **Running the Agent Backend**

1. **Navigate to agent**
   ```bash
   cd agent
   ```
   
1. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the FastAPI server:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn server:app --reload
   ```

### **Running the UI**

1. **Navigate to the UI directory:**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install UI dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server for the UI:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
